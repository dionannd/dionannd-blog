The image size of pictures used in websites plays an important role in defining an impressive website. The design of your website can be basic, unique, or based on a pre-designed theme. You can also create a custom website from scratch.

However, if this is the first time you are creating a website with images, our guide can help you get started. Here you will find guidelines and recommendations to get the best image specifications for a functional website.

## Generally recommended image sizes for websites

Here is a cheat sheet of standard image sizes for web pages best suited for a desktop with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 px (which is the most popular according to the [statistics](https://gs.statcounter.com/screen-resolution-stats/)).

## Website image guidelines

Image sizes greatly influence the user experience, Search Engine Optimization, and overall website performance. Irrespective of the type of image file used, the key to a great website is the size of the images. Here is a detailed overview of the guidelines for general image size specifications across websites.

## Background image size

- Height - 1080px
- Width - 1920px
- Aspect ratio - 16:9
- PPI - 72

<Warning>
  **Things to consider:** Depending on the design of the website, the size of
  the background image can be up to 2400px by 1600px and under 20MB in file
  size.
</Warning>
<br />
<Image
  alt="Background Image"
  caption="Background Image"
  src={"/blog/best-image-size-for-website/background.webp"}
  width={885}
  height={610}
/>

A website background image can provide a wholesome experience by taking up the entire landscape of the page. These background images are key in upping the wow factor of the brand and thus are high in quality, size, and suitable in ratio.

As long as the pixels per inch (PPI) value is at 72, you can upload a background image size of up to 2400px by 1600px or 16:9 aspect ratio. However, the ideal size is 1920px by 1080px. When uploaded at the recommended size, background images will scale or shrink according to the device. Therefore, depending on the design, the uploaded background image can be the largest image uploaded on the website with a limit of up to 20MB.

## Hero image size

- Height - 720px
- Width - 1280px
- Aspect ratio - 16:9
- PPI - 72

<Warning>
  **Things to consider:** Depending on the design of the website images of up to
  1800px in width can be used.
</Warning>
<br />
<Image
  alt="Hero Image"
  caption="Hero Image"
  src={"/blog/best-image-size-for-website/hero-image.webp"}
  width={885}
  height={796}
/>

Hero images can either take up the entire height or half the height of the page. Hero images will display well with an image size of 1280px by 720px at an aspect ratio of 16:9. If hero images are the central aspect of the website, a width of up to 1800px can achieve the desired effect. The website's loading speed can be affected by the clarity of the image.

Therefore, maintaining a 72ppi of hero images will provide both clarity and small file size for the best outcome. As a rule of thumb, the recommended load speed of a webpage should be 2 seconds for optimal traffic and SEO purposes.

Today, 90% of website traffic is generated from mobile devices. On mobile websites, the hero images display well at a size of 800px by 1200px. However, content management systems automatically scale images to suit a mobile device browser.

## Website banner size

- Height - 250px
- Width - 250px
- Aspect ratio - 1:1
- PPI - 72

<Image
  alt="Website Banner Image"
  caption="Website Banner Image"
  src={"/blog/best-image-size-for-website/ads-pagee.webp"}
  width={885}
  height={992}
/>

Website ad banners can be laid out in different sizes. Vertical, portrait, leaderboard, full/half-page, and square banners are the most common types of website banner images. Most websites opt for a banner image size of 250px by 250px or a 1:1 aspect ratio.

Vertical/sky scrapper banners are also popular at 160px by 600px. Banner images should be designed according to the dimensions required and compressed to a small image file size. Keeping the focus area of the image to the middle will avoid any cropping of the pictures when they are displayed on mobile devices. Find out more suggested banned sizes in this guide.

Mobile devices display banner images well when they are 1:9, 1:1, 1:1, or 4:5. It also helps to remember that file sizes of images should be kept as small as possible without compromising on quality. The largest image size on a website should not exceed 20MB.

## Blog image size

- Height - 630px
- Width - 1200px
- Aspect ratio - 3:2
- PPI - 72

<Warning>
  **Things to consider:** It is important to consider the area above the fold
  (the visible part before scrolling) when choosing the size of the image. If
  the image is important a larger image size should be used. If the text is
  important the size of the image can be sacrificed.
</Warning>
<br />
<Image
  alt="Website Banner Image"
  caption="Website Banner Image"
  src={"/blog/best-image-size-for-website/blog-image.webp"}
  width={885}
  height={796}
/>

When uploading blog images, remember that these images should be suited for sharing across social media channels. Generally, blog images nest well on a website at 3:2 aspect ratio or 1200px by 630px. Blog images in landscape format are best sized to 1200px by 900px and featured blog images in portrait format are best sized to 900px by 1200px.

High-quality images with small file sizes should be uploaded for blog images. For blog images, the largest recommended file size is 150KB. The smaller the file size, the better the speed of the blog. For the CMS to adapt blog images to different sizes, they should be 72ppi with the focus area centered.

## Logo size

- Height - 100px
- Width - 250px
- Aspect ratio - 2:3
- PPI - 72

<Warning>
  **Things to consider:** Logo images can be square or rectangle. Therefore, a
  1:1 or a 2:3 aspect ratio can be used.
</Warning>

The website's logo is the most crucial element that speaks of the brand and all the website's contents. On most websites, logos are displayed on the top left corner of the page or at the top center. Logos are usually uploaded in a square format at a 1:1 aspect ratio or a rectangle format of 2:3.

PNG format is the recommended file format for logo files as they have transparent backgrounds to blend into the website. For desktops, a maximum height of 100px is recommended for logos of different widths.

## Favicon size

- Height - 16 or 32 px
- Width - 16 or 32px
- Aspect ratio - 1:1
- PPI - 72

The optimal size for favicons for websites is 16px by 16px, 32px by 32px or 1:1 aspect ratio. This size is what all browsers use to display favicons. However, to avoid viewing a stretched version of the favicon on large screens, multiple image sizes are created at a 1:1 aspect ratio.

The most standard formats for favicons are ICO and PNG for compatibility across browsers. Several easy-to-access tools can convert a logo into a favicon suitable for uploading to a website.

## Mobile image size recommendations

Most responsive websites will automatically resize all images to display on mobile devices. The image sizes have to be designed to fit mobile versions of websites like desktop websites. If the desktop images are too big, the display on mobile devices will be distorted. Therefore, correct dimensions need to be set for images for automatic scaling on mobile.

Images with an aspect ratio of 1:1 will have no problem displaying on mobile devices. However, depending on the automatic resize setting, some cropping may occur on mobile devices for images with aspect ratios of 16:9 or 3:2. For this reason, the safest approach with responsive images is to keep the focus area of the subject in the middle.

## Why is image size important for websites?

One of the first things that an SEO expert would recommend is the image size of media elements on the website. Uploading large images to websites is counterproductive to the website's overall performance. Valuable website storage space is consumed, and the website's load speed can be drastically reduced. And an overlooked website speed is one of the most common SEO mistakes.

A slow website takes potential customers and website traffic away from your website. The Google Search Engine will down-rank the website, and your business will suffer.

When you upload perfectly sized images for your website theme, the results are not just limited to a seamless website. The CMS will display the images correctly, the bounce rate will be low, and you will be one step closer to a perfect SEO ranking.

## What image format to use for the web?

Since different image formats can be used on a website, it is tricky to choose which ones to use. Here are some of the most common image formats used on websites:

- **JPEG** &mdash; Being one of the most common image formats used for images, JPEG is a lightweight lossy compression image format. JPG file formats are great for products, blog, and background images used on websites.
- **PNG** &mdash; PNG is an image format that uses lossless compression. The alpha channel in PNG format allows background transparency too. PNG is perfect for icons, logos, and other graphics.
- **GIF** &mdash; The GIF file format is a nifty image file format that can be used for short animated clips with small file sizes. GIF also has an alpha channel and is excellent for product images.
- **WEBP** &mdash; WEBP images are a new image format that is becoming popular. The format offers smaller file sizes of images than JPEG at excellent quality, making it great for any product, banner, and featured image.

## Other image optimization aspects

There is more to just ensuring that the dimensions of an image are accurate when considering SEO. Below are some of the other important aspects to consider for image optimization.

## Image compression

When an image is compressed, similar pixels that make up the image are grouped and condensed using an image compression software. Keeping the image file size to the minimum aids in increasing the loading time of the website.

Apart from the load time, the bounce rate is lowered, and the overall user experience is enhanced. Compressing an image removes any metadata that is attached to the images, making it suitable for both SEO and website performance. While the quality of the image is reduced when image compression is applied, viewers can hardly notice the difference on a digital device.

## Image SEO optimization

When images are SEO optimized, they help with search engine ranking, speed, storage space, and a seamless user experience. Search engines favor websites with images not found anywhere else on the web. Image search is important to users who look for images to inspire and visually explain subjects. Therefore, image optimization helps search engines understand the content of your website.

- Unique image
- Defined dimensions
- ALT tag text and title
- Image sitemap
- Image captions
- Image size optimization
