How to configure fish config to run tmux automatically evently start the terminal.
Add new config in file `~/.config/fish/config.fish` , and type:

```shell
if not set -q TMUX
    set -g TMUX tmux new-session -d -s fish
    eval $TMUX
    tmux attach-session -d -t fish
end
```

This scripts will check the availability of shell variable TMUX. If not available, fish will set the variable and run it with eval commands. Then tmux will attach to the newly created session.

The newly created session created with a name `fish`.
