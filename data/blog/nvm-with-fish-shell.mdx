[NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) doesn't support [Fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell) shell.

Fortunately, there is an easy way to fix that. We can install the [bass](https://github.com/edc/bass) plugin to use utilities written for Bash.

Install bass using [fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher) (you can also use [oh-my-fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish)).

```shell
fisher add edc/bass
```

Install nvm (check what's the latest version).

```shell
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
```

Add fish function to `~/.config/fish/functions/nvm.fish` to load nvm:

```shell
function nvm
  bass source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh --no-use ';' nvm $argv
end
```

NVM is ready to use.

## How does it work?

You can install a specific version of node (and have multiple versions in your system):

```shell
nvm install 16
```

List all installed node versions:

```shell
nvm ls
```

Select a specific version when you need it:

```shell
nvm use 16.13.0
```

---

You can specify NodeJS version for your project and activate it using a single command:

1. Create `.nvmrc` file inside your project with node version, like `16.13.0`.
2. Use `nvm use` to active it.
